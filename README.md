# Hi, I'm Celiena. 👋
## Welcome to my page. 😄

I am a student at the U of A, and I am taking **Intro to Web Development** as an elective to a **UX/UI** certification. I am *very* new to all of this, but looking forward to all of the things that I will be learning. This is my second time attending the U of A, with my first time being in Political Science.

These are some things that I enjoy:
- Listening to music
- Watching anime
- Travelling

🎵 📺 ✈️


My top favourite travel destinations that I have been to:
1. Japan
2. New Zealand
3. France
